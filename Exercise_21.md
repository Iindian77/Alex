## Firewall Rules Audit Script: A script to audit and report on firewall rules.
David, a cybersecurity specialist, needs to regularly audit firewall rules to ensure that only authorized traffic is allowed. Keeping track of changes in firewall rules manually is inefficient and error-prone. To address this, David writes a script that compares the current firewall rules with the previous set, allowing him to quickly identify any changes or anomalies.



5. Firewall Rules Audit Script
This script audits the current firewall rules and reports any changes since the last audit.


```
#!/bin/bash

# Define the file to store the current firewall rules
current_rules="/tmp/current_iptables_rules.txt"

# Define the file to store the previous firewall rules
previous_rules="/tmp/previous_iptables_rules.txt"

# Backup the current firewall rules to the previous rules file
cp $current_rules $previous_rules

# Save the current firewall rules to the current rules file
iptables-save > $current_rules

# Compare the current and previous firewall rules
echo "Comparing current and previous firewall rules..."
diff $current_rules $previous_rules

# Check the exit status of the diff command
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  # If diff found no differences, print a message
  echo "No changes in firewall rules."
else
  # If diff found differences, print a message
  echo "Firewall rules have changed."
fi
